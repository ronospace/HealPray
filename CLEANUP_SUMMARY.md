### ⚠️ Needs Configuration (Non-Critical)
These items don't block development but should be configured before production:

1. **Firebase Setup** - Currently disabled for development
   - Need to create Firebase projects
   - Add `google-services.json` (Android)
   - Add `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS)

2. **API Keys** - Currently using placeholders
   - OpenAI API key
   - Google Gemini API key
   - Firebase configuration keys

   - App icon (1024x1024 PNG)
   - Splash screen images
   - Fonts (Poppins, Nunito Sans)

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (Ready Now)
1. ✅ Run the app: `flutter run`
2. ✅ Develop features - app compiles and runs
3. ✅ Test core functionality (auth, mood tracking, etc.)

### Before Production
1. ⚠️ Set up Firebase projects
2. ⚠️ Add real API keys to `.env`
3. ⚠️ Create brand assets (icons, splash screens)
4. ⚠️ Enable and configure Firebase services
5. ⚠️ Run full test suite
6. ⚠️ Configure iOS build settings
