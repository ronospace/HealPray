# 📱 Action 3: Test Flutter Setup (10 minutes)

## ✅ **Flutter Environment Status:**
- [x] Flutter 3.35.2 installed and working
- [x] Android toolchain ready (SDK 36.0.0)
- [x] Xcode 16.4 ready for iOS
- [x] iPhone 16 Pro Max simulator available
- [x] Android emulator available (API 36)

---

## 🎯 **Test Commands (Run These):**

### **Step 1: Install Dependencies**

```bash
# Make sure you're in the Flutter app directory
cd /Users/ronos/Workspace/Projects/Active/HealPray/healpray_mobile

# Install all dependencies
flutter pub get

# This may take 2-3 minutes for first time
```

### **Step 2: Test iOS Build**

```bash
# Run on iPhone simulator (recommended for development)
flutter run -d "iPhone 16 Pro Max"

# Or just run on any iOS device
flutter run -d ios

# The app should launch and show basic Flutter demo
# Press 'q' to quit when you see it working
```

### **Step 3: Test Android Build**  

```bash
# Run on Android emulator
flutter run -d emulator-5554

# Or run on any Android device
flutter run -d android

# The app should launch and show the same Flutter demo
# Press 'q' to quit when you see it working
```

### **Step 4: Test Hot Reload**

```bash
# Run the app and keep it open
flutter run -d ios

# While app is running, make a change to lib/main.dart
# For example, change the app title to "HealPray"
# Save the file - you should see hot reload happen instantly
# This is the magic of Flutter development!
```

## ✅ **Expected Results:**

### **Successful Build Signs:**
- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ App launches on simulator/emulator
- ✅ You see the default Flutter counter app
- ✅ Hot reload works when you make changes
- ✅ Build time < 60 seconds

### **What You Should See:**
```
Running "flutter pub get" in healpray_mobile...            2.3s
Launching lib/main.dart on iPhone 16 Pro Max in debug mode...
Running Xcode build...                                          
 └─Compiling, linking and signing...                        15.2s
🔥  To hot reload changes while running, press "r". To hot restart, press "R".

## 🛠️ **Quick Test Modifications:**

While the app is running, try these quick changes to test hot reload:

### **Change 1: App Title**
**File**: `lib/main.dart`
**Line ~32**: Change `'Flutter Demo Home Page'` to `'HealPray Demo'`

### **Change 2: Theme Color**  
**File**: `lib/main.dart`
**Line ~29**: Change `Colors.deepPurple` to `Colors.teal`

### **Change 3: Button Text**
**File**: `lib/main.dart`
**Line ~95**: Change `'Increment'` to `'Pray'`

Each change should appear instantly without restarting the app!

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting:**

### **Issue**: "Could not build the application for the simulator"
**Solution**: 
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
flutter run
```

### **Issue**: Android build fails
**Solution**: 
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run -d android
```

### **Issue**: "No connected devices"
**Solution**: 
```bash
# Start iOS Simulator
open -a Simulator

# Or start Android emulator
flutter emulators --launch android
```

### **Issue**: Hot reload not working
**Solution**: 
- Save file after making changes
- Try pressing 'r' in terminal
- Try 'R' for hot restart
