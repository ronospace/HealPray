## 🔄 **Next: After Project Creation**

Once both projects are created, we'll continue with:

1. **Configure Development Project**
   - Enable Authentication methods
   - Create Firestore database
   - Add Flutter apps (iOS & Android)

2. **Initialize Firebase in Terminal**
   ```bash
   firebase init
   flutterfire configure --project=healpray-dev
   ```

3. **Verify Setup**
   ```bash
   firebase projects:list
   # Should show healpray-dev and healpray-app
   ```

## 📝 **Project IDs to Remember:**

**Development**: `healpray-dev` (or your assigned ID)  
**Production**: `healpray-app` (or your assigned ID)

**Note**: If the preferred IDs are taken, Firebase will suggest alternatives like `healpray-dev-a1b2c` - that's totally fine!

**Status**: ⏳ **WAITING FOR MANUAL PROJECT CREATION**  
**Next**: Configure projects and initialize Firebase
