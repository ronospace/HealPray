## üîê Android Release Signing Setup

### Option 1: Create New Keystore (Recommended for first release)

```bash
cd android/app
keytool -genkey -v -keystore healpray-upload-keystore.jks \
  -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 \
  -alias healpray-key-alias
```

**IMPORTANT:** Save these credentials securely!
- Keystore password
- Key alias: healpray-key-alias
- Key password

### Option 2: Use Existing Keystore

If you already have a keystore, place it in `android/app/` directory.

### Configure Gradle for Release Signing

Create `android/key.properties`:

```properties
storePassword=<your-keystore-password>
keyPassword=<your-key-password>
keyAlias=healpray-key-alias
storeFile=healpray-upload-keystore.jks
```

**Add to .gitignore:**
```
android/key.properties
android/app/*.jks
android/app/*.keystore
```

### Update build.gradle.kts

Add before `android {` block:

```kotlin
val keystoreProperties = Properties()
val keystorePropertiesFile = rootProject.file("key.properties")
if (keystorePropertiesFile.exists()) {
    keystoreProperties.load(FileInputStream(keystorePropertiesFile))
}
```

Update `signingConfigs` and `buildTypes`:

```kotlin
signingConfigs {
    create("release") {
        keyAlias = keystoreProperties["keyAlias"] as String
        keyPassword = keystoreProperties["keyPassword"] as String
        storeFile = file(keystoreProperties["storeFile"] as String)
        storePassword = keystoreProperties["storePassword"] as String
    }
}

buildTypes {
    release {
        signingConfig = signingConfigs.getByName("release")
    }
}
```
